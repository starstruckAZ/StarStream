00:01:04:20 - 00:01:11:14
Unknown
And then.

00:01:11:16 - 00:01:55:22
Unknown
NUM num num num. And then.

00:01:55:24 - 00:02:14:02
Unknown
All wishes. Really perfect. Today we sit down with Niraj, a cosmic guardian who was freed three years ago, now living a normal life.

00:02:14:04 - 00:02:41:13
Unknown
Okay. So you want me to sit? You want me to sit right here? You may sit here. Okay. Okay, cool. All right. Do I look good? Okay. You know, you said I may be looking at the camera here, but you're you're over. You're over there. You're talking. Okay. How do you want me to start? From the beginning.

00:02:41:15 - 00:02:49:04
Unknown
Okay. Can I introduce myself?

00:02:49:06 - 00:03:12:20
Unknown
Okay. Cool. All right. So my name is Niraj, and I was a cosmic guardian for the last 3000 years. You might know it more affectionately as a genie, but I really hate. I really hate being called the genie. I'm not. I'm not a genie. I basically facilitate wishes for people across the multiverse.

00:03:12:21 - 00:03:41:02
Unknown
It's a very kind of complicated process. But yeah, I was I was freed about three years ago, and since then I've been living a human life. And, quite frankly, it sucks. I've been I've been trying to find ways to stay busy. I've then paintings. You can see when my paintings over there. Actually, I painted that and then also I've, I wrote a book.

00:03:41:04 - 00:04:04:07
Unknown
I wrote a book about my my journey, as as a as a cosmic guardian. So I this is kind of what this is about. This way. That's why they're here. That's why Starscream came and decided to. To interview me. Because I really wanted to get my story out there, but. Hey, wait, let me show you guys something real quick.

00:04:04:09 - 00:04:29:01
Unknown
This is my lamp. So Cosmic Guardians have lamps, right? And, you know, on TV, you rub it and they come out. But it doesn't quite work this way, so. So? So the way that this works actually is like, it's a portal device that opens up the multiverse. And so it's this thing that we call the Interstitium.

00:04:29:03 - 00:04:40:16
Unknown
It's a vast, beautiful network of roadways and portals that allows me to access the multiverse and grant your wish the way that you want.

00:04:40:18 - 00:04:56:21
Unknown
It gets tricky sometimes, but this might be my most prized possession. Best friends. Knowing it for 3000 years now. And when I found it, it was probably the most important thing I've ever experienced. So

00:04:56:23 - 00:05:17:15
Unknown
Is your day slipping through your fingers, or does every second feel stuck? When your personal timeline is out of sync with the world, it's isolating. You might be suffering from temporal dysmorphia. It's time to synchronize your life. It's time for Chrono Flex. Ask your doctor if Chrono Flex is right for you, and get back to the moments that matter.

00:05:17:17 - 00:05:44:01
Unknown
Side effects are generally mild and include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, and the ability to smell. Tuesdays. Do not take Chrono Flex if you are allergic to Chrono Flicks. More serious side effects may include nostalgia for events that have not yet occurred. Spontaneous dental regeneration in the belief that your reflection is blinking out of sync with you, and in rare cases, users have experienced seeing all birds as blurry, corporeal echoes of their ancestors.

Stop taking conflict and cancel your physician immediately if you begin on boiling eggs with your mind, if your shadow begins moving independently, or if you develop mid-sentence. Stoppage in.

00:06:00:04 - 00:06:09:00
Unknown
How did I become a cosmic guardian? Well, that's it's kind of a complicated story, but I originally started as a prince.

00:06:09:00 - 00:06:33:12
Unknown
I was actually a prince of a of a village called called valorous. And my father was the king of valorous and who was a pretty city state type of type of town. And we were doing all right. But the problem was, is that there were there tyrants that came and basically barbarians that came, and they were destroying every city out there.

00:06:33:14 - 00:06:55:13
Unknown
Unfortunately, my father fell to these barbarians and the the council, his council didn't really know what to do with me as a prince. I think I was about, I don't know, 23. That was so long ago. I don't know exactly how old that was, but they sent me out to exile, basically

00:06:55:15 - 00:07:01:19
Unknown
to preserve the genetic heritage and the valorous name.

00:07:01:21 - 00:07:12:01
Unknown
I basically was sent out to the desert to run away from the barbarians that killed my family and friends and destroy my city.

00:07:12:03 - 00:07:32:17
Unknown
But, I guess on a positive note, I came across a cave,

00:07:32:19 - 00:07:45:21
Unknown
and in this cave was my friend. My lamp sitting there on a on a little. On a little thing. Just sitting there.

00:07:45:23 - 00:07:51:14
Unknown
And when I touched the lamp, I saw everything.

00:07:51:14 - 00:07:59:03
Unknown
I saw the entire multiverse.

00:07:59:05 - 00:08:26:22
Unknown
But then this woman appeared. This beautiful, spiritual. I don't even know how to really describe her, even after knowing her for so long. Just this beautiful entity disappeared and she she explained to me how this lamp works. And basically I had a choice to make. I could make a wish. I could probably wish for the the barbarians to go away and maybe become king of Baldur's.

00:08:26:24 - 00:09:06:09
Unknown
But when I touch that lamp, I realized my true responsibility. And so the choices came down to either making this wish, or protecting the lamp and becoming a cosmic guardian. And so that's what I chose. I chose to to join the Cosmic Guardian ranks and go on this crazy journey that led me to this interview now. But I saw a lot of things when I touched that lamp, and I knew that I needed to protect those things.

00:09:06:11 - 00:10:40:01
Unknown
And so this woman, who her name is divine, by the way, she kind of acted as a guide and really pushed me to understand exactly how the interstitium worked, how the wishes worked. And she kind of held my hand during the first couple of years and first couple of wishes of working things out. But yeah, that's that's kind of how it all started for me.

00:10:40:03 - 00:10:59:14
Unknown
Oh, what I miss most about being a cosmic guardian. Probably the power. I mean, you, lady, you get to see every single possibility, every single person that you ask for a wish and I've seen some crazy shit.

00:10:59:16 - 00:11:05:14
Unknown
And I've saved lives. I've started wars, I've ended wars.

00:11:05:16 - 00:11:33:21
Unknown
I've done all kinds of amazing, beautiful stuff. So the power is probably what I miss the most. But it's not like a, a great thing is just the ability to to help, to help others, you know, like even when I was a prince and a, I was still, still trying to help others, you know, like I was definitely not greedy or spoiled, but the things that seen and the people that I've encountered, man, there's there's some fucked up people out there.

00:11:33:21 - 00:11:39:02
Unknown
I tell you what,

00:11:39:04 - 00:11:52:13
Unknown
And the thing about being a cosmic guardian is that you don't really have the ability to say no. You just get to choose the wish that makes the most sense for the person that's asking for it.

00:11:52:15 - 00:12:14:08
Unknown
And that can be tricky. Like, obviously like I don't, I'm not the type to cause a dictatorship or genocide and kill a bunch of people, but that's what they wish for. So I have to find some type of middle ground that's going to maybe satisfy his wish and then also save people's lives. I know previous Cosmic Guardians, they would just grant the wish and just move on.

00:12:14:08 - 00:12:38:00
Unknown
But that's it's a hard ass for me to to murder millions of people, you know. So that was a tricky one. There's been many like that where I've had to come to like, you know, like cosmic decisions and choices that really define the multiverse as we know it. And that was just another one. But that was definitely probably like one of the hardest choices I ever had to make.

00:12:38:02 - 00:14:07:13
Unknown
Really.

00:14:07:15 - 00:14:34:12
Unknown
How did I get free? Oh, that's, it's, it's a touchy subject, but, I mean, it all starts with a girl, as most stories do. As I got better, traveling the interest at gym and learning how to grant wishes and ways that helped keep the interest at gym together. I got a little cocky.

00:14:34:12 - 00:14:49:02
Unknown
Became more experienced. But one woman in particular, when I was sent to her universe, she just refused to make a wish.

00:14:49:04 - 00:15:06:12
Unknown
Malala. That's her name. Malala. And Malala was probably the most beautiful person I've ever met in my life. But she was a bit stubborn. She refused to grant wishes. She did. She? I kept asking her like, what was your wish?

00:15:06:12 - 00:15:32:03
Unknown
What? What your wish, what you wish? And she didn't really needed anything, which was weird because usually the lamp itself, it's it's drawn towards people who have a need and have a, have a want. And so I couldn't quite understand why the lamp brought me to her. I couldn't get it. But she never made the wish, at least not for her whole life.

00:15:32:05 - 00:15:45:19
Unknown
And so I was kind of stuck there. But what's beautiful about it is that, I mean, we fell in love and she. She reminded me what it was like to be human again.

00:15:45:21 - 00:15:55:20
Unknown
I remember holding hands in the park. I remember arguing about TV shows, reality shows while sitting there on the couch. I remember the way she would smell in the morning and just

00:15:55:22 - 00:15:59:19
Unknown
her hair, her shampoo that she used to wear.

00:15:59:21 - 00:16:27:16
Unknown
Her beauty radiated anything I ever seen before across the interstitium. And keep in mind, I was millennia deep at this point, 3000 years as a cosmic guardian, and I never had experienced anything so beautiful as Malala. So honestly, I didn't mind being stuck there in that universe with her and honestly able to stay forever. However, you know, time is a is a bitch.

00:16:27:18 - 00:16:30:01
Unknown
And she got sick.

00:16:30:03 - 00:16:59:03
Unknown
She got really sick. And basically as as she got older, and I didn't age because Cosmic Guardians don't age. I begin to see the the. This the the sadness in her eyes when she realized that she wouldn't be able to be around anymore. And there's a bit of guilt there. I have cosmic powers with a snap of my finger.

00:16:59:03 - 00:17:19:11
Unknown
I could I could heal her with a snap. My finger. I can change everything with an instant. And I told her that I would. I would plead with her, I would say, but it please just make a wish to make yourself better or heal. And she would and she would say, oh no, that's that's not in God's design.

00:17:19:13 - 00:17:39:24
Unknown
And I mean, as someone who travels the multiverse and does this in that, I don't even know if God exists, because why would God take someone from me who I love so much? Why would God let that happen? Right?

00:17:40:01 - 00:18:16:07
Unknown
But I respected her wishes. I never used my powers to heal her despite daily asking her just to make that one wish that would that would keep us together. And maybe there was a bit of selfishness there. I don't know, that's possible, probably. But I love their I never loved anything more than her. And so to see her wither away, see her, get sick, see her, get frail, it was tearing me apart.

00:18:16:09 - 00:18:55:00
Unknown
The the day that she died, she called me into the room. She was on her deathbed, and she. She grabbed the lamp. The lamp was always sitting there on her, on her nightstand. It was sitting there for years, untouched, even collecting dust because she just never she never touched it. But she she picked it up, and she looked me in, in my eye, and she she she told me she's like Niraj, I finally know what I want to wish for.

00:18:55:02 - 00:19:11:15
Unknown
And I'm thinking, oh yeah, this is going to be great. She's going to she's going to finally herself. Maybe she's going to turn back time. I can do anything. I could do anything that she wants to do right now. Just let me know. And so she grabs the lamp and she basically says,

00:19:11:17 - 00:19:14:13
Unknown
Raj.

00:19:14:15 - 00:19:15:06
Unknown
I wish you were

00:19:15:10 - 00:20:08:16
Unknown
free.

00:20:08:18 - 00:20:23:13
Unknown
Sound satisfaction. Nothing pops like the paper bowl. Two teams, 100ft of industrial bubble wrap and every snap count. Last season, Boston and Chicago went bubble for a bubble to a dead even finish. Who burst through this year? Find out. Saturday, February 23rd live on Star Stream Sport.

00:20:23:15 - 00:20:51:12
Unknown
Welcome to season, the only competition where seasoning is a disqualifier. I call it bread with ambition, ambition or omission. One boiled potato in a bowl of hot water. That's bravery in its blandest form. Bravery. I taste existential dread. Who'll rise to the occasion and still taste like nothing.

00:20:51:14 - 00:21:05:11
Unknown
Rogers journey is one of heartbreak and tragedy, but also one of perserverance and wisdom. Join us as we continue to learn more for this cosmic wonder.

00:21:05:13 - 00:21:37:00
Unknown
Now there's a problem with this wish. Early on in the story, as I was explaining things, I made a choice to be a cosmic guardian. I wasn't a slave to the lamp. I chose to be a cosmic guardian. There's no no captivity, no restraints. It was a choice that I made to serve the land. So her wish created a bit of a problem.

00:21:37:02 - 00:22:10:06
Unknown
And that problem was that it didn't exist. You can't wish for someone to be free who chooses their servitude. This caused a lot of problems. The wish basically shattered the lamp into multiple pieces. Seven, to be exact. And they were spread out across the interstate. You confused? And since I was technically free because the lamp broke, there was no guardian to guide them.

00:22:10:08 - 00:22:19:13
Unknown
Divine had moved on. She had other guardians to train. She had a interstitium to keep together. So.

00:22:19:15 - 00:22:40:17
Unknown
Safe to say that things were pretty fucked at that point. I was thrown into this universe that I'm in right now with you motherfuckers over here. I start stream and I've been here ever since. I've been trapped in here ever since. And I don't want to say it, trapped is the is the right word. I'm aging. I'm experiencing life as a human.

00:22:40:19 - 00:23:10:08
Unknown
It's great. But the problem is, is that I don't. I didn't have a chance to really. Say goodbye to Malala. When the wish. When she made the wish, I just I left. I was, I was, I was thrusted into this universe, and she probably passed away. But there was also another side effect to her wish. And that's basically the concept of the multiverse, right?

00:23:10:08 - 00:23:42:21
Unknown
Quantum mechanics. There's a multiverse, a universe, a realm for every decision that you make as a person, which means that there's a realm that kept Malala alive. There's a version of me that was out there who decided to use his cosmic powers to save her and keep her alive for years.

00:23:42:23 - 00:24:15:04
Unknown
They ended up having a beautiful life together, and she ended up passing away. But not because of how she died, but because she found out that what the other me did, which was basically deny her her freedom of choice, denied her of her peaceful demise, that she chose on her own will. He took that away from her. So she left.

00:24:15:06 - 00:24:20:08
Unknown
And ever since that point.

00:24:20:10 - 00:24:24:00
Unknown
He decided to fix things.

00:24:24:02 - 00:24:28:15
Unknown
He wanted to fix things, you know, fucking fix things.

00:24:28:17 - 00:24:35:12
Unknown
And so he comes to my universe

00:24:35:14 - 00:24:54:03
Unknown
talking shit, calling me an asshole for letting Malala die and tells me that I'm the reason why things are falling apart. It's his job to fix it. And so we fight

00:24:54:05 - 00:24:57:07
Unknown
this to fix, magic to magic.

00:24:57:07 - 00:25:08:09
Unknown
Whatever. Now, keep in mind, I haven't been using my cosmic powers for the last three years. I'm a little rusty. So he watched my ass

00:25:08:11 - 00:25:13:21
Unknown
beat the fuck out of me and pretty much left me to die.

00:25:13:23 - 00:26:20:04
Unknown
Treat a tiny treat or a door. Bite it and the world bleeds. But not all trips are roundtrip. You might not come back. Some doors don't close behind you. Magic mushrooms are not magic. Think before you begin.

00:26:20:06 - 00:26:30:03
Unknown
How can Northridge defeat a more determined, sinister version of himself? The 360 view dives deeper into his story.

00:26:30:05 - 00:26:44:23
Unknown
He told me that his plan was to to rebuild the interest interested gym in his image, led by love and not cosmic responsibility and I didn't know what to do.

00:26:44:23 - 00:27:03:12
Unknown
So I went to go visit my mentor, divine, who was trying to hold up this broken interstitium in the core.

00:27:03:14 - 00:27:29:12
Unknown
And when I saw her twisted and just decayed and dark, her energy just spread out across the building. I knew that something wasn't quite right with her. And so I explained to her, I explained her, I told her, hey, divine, this is what happened.

00:27:29:12 - 00:27:47:06
Unknown
This is why we're in this state right now. Because this woman named Malala, it's a woman I fell in love with. She wished me free. Divine's eyes went, why? Whatever version of I she had.

00:27:47:08 - 00:27:49:21
Unknown
Malala.

00:27:49:23 - 00:27:54:03
Unknown
I, I recognize that name.

00:27:54:05 - 00:28:04:22
Unknown
And it was at that point that I realized that divine was a version of Malala,

00:28:04:24 - 00:28:14:23
Unknown
my boss. This entire time, guiding me through the multiverse was a version of Malala. Her story turned out that because of quantum mechanics and all this stuff works.

00:28:15:00 - 00:28:24:04
Unknown
Malala in another universe, in another version, wished to be a cosmic guardian, just like I did.

00:28:24:06 - 00:28:56:17
Unknown
She wished that she could do the same thing that I was doing and grant wishes across the multiverse. And in that version, she became the core of the Interstitium and then use that energy to go find other cosmic Guardians to find me. That's it's it's it's fucking crazy. I didn't know that the entire time that this spiritual entity that was guiding me across the multiverse was the love of my life, who died.

00:28:56:19 - 00:29:08:22
Unknown
So divine told me that she couldn't leave. She was trapped. I had to go find the fragments that had to go find the seven fragments.

00:29:08:24 - 00:29:26:22
Unknown
And that meant confronting old wishes. It meant granting new wishes and meant helping people understand why their wish was the way that it was.

00:29:26:24 - 00:29:31:09
Unknown
And it was quite the journey. So you wait until you get,

00:29:31:11 - 00:29:33:22
Unknown


00:29:33:24 - 00:29:41:24
Unknown
It's probably the hardest thing I ever done was getting those fucking fragments. But we did it.

00:29:42:01 - 00:30:12:13
Unknown
And when the happening was, I had to confront other me, he was doing the same thing, collecting his fragments, and he got most of them. But I managed to get a couple enough to keep him from stopping his goal because once you rebuild this lab and you are able to rework the interstitium, he could rebuild it in his image.

00:30:12:15 - 00:30:33:20
Unknown
He found me first, though. I mean, he's me. He had to know what I was doing, right? So he found me first and he came to me and he basically told me, you're a fucking idiot. You're a fucking idiot. Why would you stop me from finding true love? Why would you not let me change the interstitium into something that would make sense?

00:30:33:22 - 00:30:54:23
Unknown
Because cosmic responsibility doesn't always make sense. But love does. And honestly, I couldn't argue with him on that. He's right. Love is one of the most powerful energies that I've ever experienced throughout my entire millennia as a cosmic guardian. Some of these wishes that I granted were powered by love. Matter of fact, most wishes were powered by love.

00:30:55:00 - 00:31:13:12
Unknown
It's the core of it all. But I couldn't just let him change everything and alter cosmic responsibility. He could destroy the entire multiverse. So we fought again.

00:31:13:14 - 00:31:18:20
Unknown
waited for this moment. You're not me. You're just a shadow. A shadow that

00:31:18:23 - 00:31:34:08
Unknown
He's, He's a formidable one. And I got a little bit, better traveling the multiverse looking for these fragments. But he still managed to to beat me,

00:31:34:10 - 00:31:39:13
Unknown
I.

00:31:39:15 - 00:32:20:02
Unknown
and he banished me into a far off realm

00:32:20:04 - 00:32:42:03
Unknown
At Dinah Mason. We don't just study quantum reality. We build it. Join the minds. Turning possibility into programs.

00:32:42:05 - 00:32:49:11
Unknown
I crash land in the desert, and my lamp's there.

00:32:49:13 - 00:33:05:01
Unknown
My fake lamp. And I basically had to walk all the way back, figure out how to get back to the interstitium, figure out how to get back to divine

00:33:05:03 - 00:33:43:03
Unknown
fortunately, that last piece, that fragment that I had, I was able to use it to access the core of my cosmic powers,

00:33:43:05 - 00:34:05:14
Unknown
that last piece, that fragment that I had, I was able to use it to access the core of my cosmic powers, which allow me to cross interstitium and get to the core.

00:34:05:16 - 00:34:28:10
Unknown
And when I got to the core, everything was changed. Everything was dark crystals, everything was dark energy, shadows. It was. It was disturbing. And so I just walked in hoping to maybe talk to him,

00:34:28:12 - 00:34:43:02
Unknown
get a chance to explain why he's so wrong in his decision making. Here. That didn't go over very well. Another fight broke out.

00:34:43:04 - 00:34:45:03
Unknown
But he beat the fuck out of me, honestly.

00:34:45:05 - 00:34:47:16
Unknown
But.

00:34:47:18 - 00:35:05:07
Unknown
I still had my fragment. And what's beautiful about that is the fact that I was free. Yeah, sure. I still have my cosmic powers, but I wasn't bound by the laws of the lamp I was. I could make a wish.

00:35:05:09 - 00:35:10:24
Unknown
And then.

00:35:11:01 - 00:35:19:04
Unknown
And so I did. And I wished to know who I truly am. No, what I am, deep down in the core of my being.

00:35:19:04 - 00:35:39:15
Unknown
What does this all mean? Why are we all here? I want to know the answer. And the revelation was, is that we're all one consciousness. You camera guy over here. Me divine. But we're all one

00:35:39:17 - 00:35:42:19
Unknown
raw, one.

And once he realized that everything changed, he realized that he's only fighting himself. He's only fighting these laws for the sake of his own consciousness, experiencing life. It's kind of beautiful. It's a little poetic, but it's also kind of sad because it kind of dictates the loneliness that our spirits are derived from. Here we get so lonely that we create realms powered by love in order to feel something.

If you're just a spiritual entity that's floating in the world, floating in the universe, floating the multiverse wherever you're floating, you might experience everything at once. But what does it mean to actually feel? What does it mean to actually be human? Which is what I've been processing these last few years, what it really means to be human. And yeah, sure, it hurts.

I can't travel the multiverse. I can't, you know, save the day like I wish I could, but I feel something.

When your bucket list says go big. These legends say oh my cringiest pictures. Skydiving. Skateboarding. Bungee jumping. Pretty much anything their grandkids told them not to do. I left a note bucket listing new reality.

Welcome to season, the only competition where seasoning is a disqualifier. I call it bread with ambition, ambition or omission. One boiled potato in a bowl of hot water. That's bravery in its blandest form. Bravery. I taste existential dread. Who'll rise to the occasion and still taste like nothing.

And so after I revealed that spiritual consciousness to him,

00:37:39:14 - 00:37:55:14

he disappeared. He realized they were all one. And I was able to talk to the violence. Hell, divine. How important she was to me.

She understood. But we could never be together, at least not in the form that she was in.

She's a spiritual entity holding together a multiverse. That's not what it is. And Layla was long gone, and we died. But she explained to me that there's always going to be someone else to love. There's always going to be another version of Malayali, another version of divine, because we're all the same consciousness. You're just loving yourself. And so, I mean that, I guess.

I guess the happy part about this story is that, yeah, I am in my my apartment by my house here in the city, living as a human, but I am. I'm married. I did find someone that was willing to accept me for who I am, cosmic guardian or not. And I just think that's beautiful. Would I would I do it all again?

00:38:53:17 - 00:39:28:06

Absolutely, absolutely. It's something that lets her. What would I would I go back to being a cosmic guardian? I think that that journey might be over. Maybe many. Neeraj might pick up the lamp, but for me, I think I'm done. I found what makes me happy. I found my own cosmic guardian. Found my own wish.
